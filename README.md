---

**Q: Is there a trader?**<br>
**A: There is a bug with this feature causing a failure, it is being fixed but it is a very complexly coded feature so it is taking some time to solve the issue, in the meantime we have alternative solutions that admins can do:**

> [!NOTE]
> `/admin spawner add selection: xcoord: ycoord: zcoord: item: lifetime: eventname: nominal: maxamount: minamount: restock:` <sub>is to build an event via discord directly into your files</sub>
> `/admin spawer remove eventname:EXACT EVENT NAME` <sub>to remove it from your files</sub>

> [!NOTE]
> `/webinterface upload file: folder:` <sub>to upload a custom made json file to your server<sub>
>
> `/gameplay edit choice: option: filename:` <sub>to add the new json file to the ObjectSpawnerArr in cfggameplay.json<sub>
---

**Q: What features does Legion Killfeed have?**<br>
**A: There is not a full compiled list of features as of yet, but majority of them are listed in [#features](https://discord.com/channels/1122399232414990438/1130522659017465966)**

---

**A: There is going to be one which will help resolve the issue with the trader**
> [!CAUTION]
> Currently any scheduler commands that show in discord will not work until it is complete.
---

**Q: I feel like the killfeed is being slow?**<br>
**A: The killfeed is only ever delayed by Nitrado being slow to update logs, we check for new logs every 4-7mins, which is shown in [#killfeed-loop](https://discord.com/channels/1122399232414990438/1122435730271113258) (channel only visible to subscribers and their staff)**

> [!NOTE]
> If it's been more than 15mins since a message has been posted in that channel, bring it to our attention and the delays will immediately be investigated if a developer is online.
---

**Q: Why is Soul an asshole/rude/a dick?**<br>
**A: There are many reasons you could `think` Soul is being an asshole, he is not intending to sound like a dick or come across rudely (most of the time).**

- He's Australian, it's how most Australians talk
- He's just direct and raw/unfiltered

> [!NOTE]
> If he's debugging an issue while responding to you he's also checking:
>
> - the bot log file
> - the command usage
> - the database and
> - the code
> - all at once, because of this often his speed of response is seen as rude

> [!WARNING]
> He swears, he's an adult, get over it, he's not calling anyone names, he's using swear words to express frustration or annoyance

> [!CAUTION]
> He has ADHD, most people with ADHD have issues communicating properly and often have trouble:
>
> - understanding what others say
> - remembering details
> - understanding social nuances
> - organizing thoughts
> - staying on task during conversations
>
---

**Q: My server ran out of time, how do I turn the killfeed back on for it?**<br>
**A: Currently, you need to do `/setup token` then `/setup activate` to turn it back on**

> [!NOTE]
> The `/setup new` command will not add it back anymore as it was abused to bypass paying for the subscription.
---

**Q: Why is one of my members blacklisted from the bot?**<br>
**A: There could be a number of reasons, most people blacklisted have either;**

- Made threats towards staff here
- Made threats towards staff members family members
- Been caught using cheating devices to boost their stats (like a cronus)
- Used the killfeed then at the end of their subscriptions requested a refund via PayPal
- Violated our [ToS](https://killfeed.co/legal#terms-of-service).

> [!WARNING]
> These people will never be given access to our services again, it's their own fault and no compromises will be made.
---

**Q: Why is it telling me to subscribe if I already have?**<br>
**A: There are multiple reasons you could be getting this message, check all of the below before opening a ticket.**

- Is your discord account linked to your ko-fi account?
  - If not link it [here](https://ko-fi.com/Discord/Settings)
- Were you a member of the discord at the time of subscribing or before trying to use token?
  - If you weren't, open a ticket [here](https://discord.com/channels/1122399232414990438/1138583694517489764) and ask a developer to check your activation

> [!NOTE]
> If everything is active but you're still getting the error, like for example, from a command, it could be you're not in the assigned channel for those commands, the subscribe message is a fallback response on some commands, we are updating these to be accurate to the error.
---

<!--#Tickets -->

**Q: How do I setup the ticket system?**<br>
**A: The ticket system auto-deletes if not fully setup correctly, Once you've done:**

- `/tickets setup panel` & `/tickets setup welcome` & `/ticket setup style` you do `/tickets setup finish`
>
> - the bot will create a:
>   - category
>   - ticket channel
>   - archive channel

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Ticket Panel is the message that you use to open tickets
> - The first message in the ticket is the Welcome Panel

![ticket-system.png](https://i.postimg.cc/tCvbTtQY/ticket-system.png)

> [!NOTE]
> When they open they are just private threads
> The ticket role is pinged which adds the staff to the private thread
> Only admins and owner can add people to a ticket but to do so you just ping someone and they're added

> [!WARNING]
> Pinging a role will add all members with the role to the ticket
